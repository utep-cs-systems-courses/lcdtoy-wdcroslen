## Introduction
This code starts with a "Hello World!" welcom message on the beginning screen
and with each button press changes screens to display a new message as well as
a Tetris piece!

If you press the first and fourth switch simultaneously you will also go to a
new screen and the first and second switch will turn the cpu off.

switch presses. "loadx" make production loads it into the launchpad board.
